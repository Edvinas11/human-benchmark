dotnet run
```
or using Docker Compose
```
cd AimReactionAPI
docker-compose up --build
```

## Project Structure
### Main Components
- ```User```
- ```Target```
- ```GameConfig```
- ```Score```

### Data Flow
1. User Uploads Config File (Frontend to Backend):
   - User uploads a game configuration file through the frontend.
   - Frontend sends a ```POST``` request to backend.
   - Backend processed the file, parses it and validates it.
   - The validated configuration file is saved in the database.
2. Game Initiation and Interaction:
   - User starts a game.
   - Frontend sends a ```GET``` request.
   - Backend creates a game session, retrieves necessary configurations and sends game-specific data to the frontend.
   - User interacts with the game.
   - When the game ends, score is submitted.
   - Score is validated and saved in the database.
3. Leaderboard Data Fetch:
   - Frontend fetches leaderboard data
   - Backend queries the DB and returns the top scores for display.
